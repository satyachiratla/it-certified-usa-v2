          remaining engaged in the areas of their interest and expertise. This
          way every professional develops a broader vision and acquires
          attitudes to perform as a more responsible and committed team member,
          one who is sensitive to each otherâ€™s roles but who is not shy of
          making suggestions or constructive criticism.
        </p>
